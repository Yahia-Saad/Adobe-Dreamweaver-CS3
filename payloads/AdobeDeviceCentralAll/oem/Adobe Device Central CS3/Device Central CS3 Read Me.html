				<a name="A6" id="A6"></a><h2>QuickTime installation </h2>
			</div>
			<div id="description">
				Video playback in Device Central requires Apple QuickTime Player version 7 or higher to be installed on your system. If you do not install QuickTime, you will not be able to play back video and certain sound formats included in your Flash Lite documents. To install QuickTime on your system, go to the Apple download site at <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download</a> and follow the installation instructions.
				
			</div>
			<div id="title">
				<a name="A7" id="A7"></a><h2>Font emulation</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="description">In order to accurately emulate fonts defined in your Flash document, make sure that the desired font is installed on your system. If your Flash movie uses one of Flash's generic device font &quot;types&quot; (_sans, _serif, _typewriter), Flash Lite will replace those by a respective font available on the system. Since most native fonts on devices are manufacturer-owned, they might not be available on your computer. The Device Central Preferences provide a respective mapping of common Windows and Mac OS system fonts for the three generic device font types. If you have the actual device font of a manufacturer installed or simply want to use a different font as the default, go to the Device Central Preferences and remap the generic font &quot;types&quot; as desired. Font mapping is supported for different languages. You can only map fonts that are installed on your system and that comply with the selected language's encoding.

				<a name="A8" id="A8"></a><h2>Known issues</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="description">
				<strong>Player </strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Flash Lite 1.1 and Flash Lite 2.x players always return &quot;false&quot; for the <tt>_capStreamSound</tt> capability, independent of the device profile information. </li>
					<li>Flash Lite 2.x players always return &quot;true&quot; for the <tt>System.capabilities.hasStreamingAudio</tt> property, independent  of the device profile information.  </li>
					<li>Flash Lite 2.x players always return &quot;true&quot; for the <tt>hasQWERTYKeyboard</tt> system capability, independent of the device profile information. </li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Input </strong>
				<ul>
					<li>For some devices, the <tt>mouseType</tt> capability might not be emulated correctly if &lt;mouseType value=&quot;Partial&quot;/&gt;. This means that the supported mouse events in the emulator may differ from those supported on an actual device. Always verify that the mouse events work as expected on the actual device.</li>
					<li>The <tt>hasStylus</tt> system capability returns &quot;false&quot; if &lt;mouseType value=&quot;Stylus&quot;/&gt;.</li>
					<li>Device Central does not check whether the tested file complies with the strict file naming conventions of BREW devices. If you want to target BREW devices, make sure your file complies with the BREW rules.</li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Videos &amp; images included in a SWF file</strong><br/>
				Videos and images included in a SWF file always play back in the emulator, independent of whether this is supported on the actual device. To check support for video and images within a SWF, select the desired target device/s, click the Device Profiles tab, and go to the Flash section. If video and images in a SWF are supported, the respective formats will be listed.
				<br/><br/><strong>SWF content included in Web pages</strong>
				<br/>On Windows, the emulator does not play back Flash content embedded in Web pages. On Mac OS, Device Central uses the Flash desktop plug-in, which might lead to unexpected results with Flash Lite content. <br/>
					<br/>We recommend that you test embedded Flash Lite content separately.
				<br/><br/><strong>Sound</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>BREW-specific sound formats such as QCELP, CMX, and BCI are not played back.</li>
					<li>The <tt>soundChannels</tt> capability is always returned as &quot;Stereo&quot;, independent of whether the device profiles indicate support for mono sounds only.</li>
					<li>The Flash Lite 1.1 player always returns &quot;Yes&quot; for the <tt>multipleDeviceSounds</tt> capability, even if the device profile indicates that mixing of multiple sounds is not supported.</li>
					<li>SWF movies with multiple native PCM raw sounds embedded to play at the same time (mixing), might cause some playback quality issues on Flash Lite 2.x players.</li>
					<li>Quality issues might occur when playing back MIDI files. To improve quality, try to change the default synthesizer in the QuickTime System Settings to General MIDI.</li>
					<li>On Mac OS, it might occur that small portions of sound are skipped at the beginning.</li>
					<li>On Mac OS, you might experience some quality issues with Flash Lite 2.x players when playing back native MP3, MFI, and MIDI formats.</li>
					<li>On Mac Power PCs, SMAF-5 files might skip and cut out during playback.</li>
					<li>Sound playback might stutter when quickly dragging around the application window on the screen. </li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Performance</strong>
				<br/>Each device profile includes Performance Index information, which is the result of a performance test that Adobe ran on the actual device. This performance index allows to categorize devices. The higher the index, the better the performance. To simulate device performance on your computer, it is necessary to run a calibration process first. During this calibration process, Device Central runs the same SWF file that was used during the performance test on the actual device. The result of the calibration on your computer is then set into relation to the device performance index. <br/>
				<br/><i>Note: that the performance simulation is an approximation to the real device performance.<br/>
				</i><br/> The SWF file used for calibration includes text, bitmap, and vector tweens. Therefore, the performance simulation will be most accurate for this sort of content. Functionality, such as XML parsing, ActionScript, and networking, have not been considered in this performance test. <br/>
					<br/>
					To achieve most accurate simulation results, perform device calibration frequently, because other processes running on your computer affect performance. Final testing must always be done on the actual device.<br/>
				<br/><strong>FSCommand2 commands </strong><br/>
				SetFullScreen: Every SWF file is emulated as if set to Fullscreen.<br/>
				
				<br/>SetInputTextType: The emulator ignores text input restrictions to Latin/Non Latin characters.<br/>
					<br/>
				
				The following FSCommand2 commands are emulated as if supported, even if the device profile includes different information.<br/>
				
				<br/>All Flash Lite players: 
				
				<ul>
					<li>Escape, Unescape&nbsp;</li>
					<li>GetFreePlayerMemory, GetTotalPlayerMemory</li>
					<li>GetTimezoneOffset&nbsp;<br/>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Flash Lite 2.x players:
				
				<ul>
					<li>GetDateDay, GetDateMonth, GetDateWeekday, GetDateYear</li>
					<li>GetTimeHour, GetTimeMinute, GetTimeSecond
					</li>
				</ul>
